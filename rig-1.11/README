This is RIG, a program that generates fake identities. Install should be
fairly straightforward, just type "make install". If your system dosen't 
have /dev/urandom and you'd like to use /dev/random instead, do
$ make install CFLAGS=-DDEVRANDOM

RIG comes with the top 1000 names from the US census at 
http://www.census.gov/genealogy/names/, but Trent Stanley maintains a 
more extensive list at http://members.cox.net/gps/rignames_all.zip

If you have any patches, fixes, etc., just send 'em on over to
vectro@RIG.sourceforge.net.
