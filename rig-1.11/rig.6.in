.SH DESCRIPTION
Rig is a utility that will piece together a random first name,
last name, street number and address, along with a geographically
consistant (ie, they all match the same area) city, state, ZIP code,
and area code.
.PP
It is suitable for such applications as feeding the NY times registration
page to fend off junk (snail) mail and telemarketers, or for registering on
BBS's to which you don't wish to reveal your real information.

Respectively, use female and male names. If neither or both options are
selected, RIG uses both female and male names.

default directory of DATADIR is assumed.
